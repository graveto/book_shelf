## A book tracking app

This app is solving a problem I have with books. I often look at books at Goodwill. I never remember if I have a particular book. 
This app allows me to enter a book's information (ISBN, author, title, series, number in the series). 
I can enter the information manually or use a scanner to look the book info up on Google Books API. 
Book information can be updated and books can be deleted.
Books can also be searched by title, author, series, or number in the series.
